    <h1>How to explain block chain to your friends and family.</h1>
    <p>When I first heard about the position at Blockchain Tech LTD. I was very excited to tell my friends and family about this opportunity. Of course this led to a lot of questions. Below is my attempt at explaining the concepts behind blockchain to them, through the questions which they asked.</p>
    <ul class="questions">

  <section id="what-is-it" class="answers">
    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>Block chain is the fundamental innovation of Bitcoin. Basically, it is a public record of every transaction ever in a system that can be verified by users.</p>
    <p>More specifically it is a ledger of digital events that is shared and verified publicly among users of the system. It can only be updated by consensus of a majority of the participants in the system. Once this information is entered, it can never be erased. This means that the block chain contains a verifiable record of every single transaction ever made inside the system. This means that users of the system are able to verify that a transaction is valid without relying on a central authority such as a bank or government to do so.</p>

  <section id="how-does-it-work" class="answers">
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>Math. Lots of math. So much math that trying to cheat the system would be cost prohibitive. Below is an example of a mathematical equations involved in block chain, and this isn't even the hard stuff:</p>
      <div class="equation">
        <img class="math" src="/assets/7255DF4A-9F8D-4375-A39F-022A64722E21.png"></img>
        <img class="math" src="/assets/18C5988F-6594-41B6-96F4-42B0480A08B7.png"></img>
        <img class="math" src="/assets/DC06D603-0790-4591-AB46-873A2925096F.png"></img>
        <img class="math" src="/assets/C4237ADB-0B8F-463D-9CE4-AB6DDD1246C3.png"></img>
      </div>
    <p>The block chain consists of files called blocks. A block is a record of some or all of the most recent transactions in a system that have not yet been recorded in any prior blocks. A block could be compared to a page in a ledger that records for example incoming and outgoing goods.</p>
    <p>In addition to this record of transactions, each block in the chain also contains a reference to the block that came immediately before it. In the beginning there was just one block (the genesis block). By storing a reference to the previous block in the chain a record of each blocks path back to the genesis block is created.</p>
    <img class="intext-image" src="/assets/blockchain-simple.png"></img>
    <p>Finally each block contains the answer to a difficult mathematical puzzle that is unique to each block. Without this answer blocks cannot be submitted to the chain. This mathematical problem in each block is extremely difficult to solve, but once a solution is found, it is very easy for the rest of the network to confirm that the solution is correct. The prices of solving these equations is what is known as “mining”.</p>
    <p>These innovations allow technologies built on the block chain to be public, anonymous and secure. By using mathematically derived methods of securing transactions users no longer need to put their trust in a central authority, and can instead rely on the publicly available distributed ledger that block chain provides to ensure that their transactions are secure.</p>

  <section id="why-should-i-care" class="answers">
    <h2>Why should I care?</h2>
    <p>Most people have heard about Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but many are not aware that block chain has a variety of other potential uses. These range from smart contracts, voting, micropayments, crowdfunding, distributed exchanges, smart property, and secure transfer of sensitive documents such as health records.</p>
    <p>A number of these technologies have the ability to integrate seamlessly into our lives and the technologies that we are already comfortable using. Other uses of the block chain will create new ways of doing things that most of us cannot envision at this early stage of the technology's development.</p>

  <section id="is-it-really-that-big-of-a-deal" class="answers">
    <h2>Is it really that big of a deal?</h2>
    <p>Yes, block chain has the potential to change the way that many industries and governments function. Many tech industry leaders and pundits have suggested that block chain technology will bring about changes to society on a similar scale to those that have been brought about by Internet technologies.</p>
    <p>This is due in part to the security and anonymity that the decentralized nature of block chain provides. Right now when we want a transaction or relationship to be secure we rely on a central authority to ensure that transaction is secure, however these central authorities can be hacked, make mistakes, or may be corrupt. In the future this authority will reside with the users of a system allowing greater freedom and security in digital transactions.</p>
